# Journaling Startup Journey in reconfigured

Welcome to your guide for using reconfigured to track and organize your startup journey. Whether you're validating ideas, building an MVP, raising funds, or growing your team, reconfigured helps you create a journal of your thinking — structured around quests.

This document walks through:

- The core concepts of quests, objectives, and entries
- A quick setup to get started
- Real-world examples of how to structure your founder journey using reconfigured

## Core Concepts

### Quests

A quest is a loose but defined container for a topic. It's up to you to decide what a quest is, but typically a quest is a question or a desired answer for a question. It could be:

- A business model exploration
- A product validation experiment
- A fundraising strategy
- A question about your target market

Rule of thumb: If you'd want to revisit, share, or reflect on it later — make it a quest.

### Objectives → Sidequests

Each quest can have objectives, which are automatically treated as linked subquests. This allows you to break the work down into smaller chunks without cluttering the main thread.

We recommend a structure like:

```
Main Quest: Validate Product-Market Fit
├── Objective: Identify target personas
│     → Sidequest: Customer interview findings
├── Objective: Test value proposition
│     → Sidequest: Landing page conversion test
├── Objective: Measure problem severity
│     → Sidequest: User pain point assessment
```

This keeps your exploration clean, focused, and expandable as you learn more.

### Entries

Entries are your trail of thought. They can be:

- Long-form notes
- Customer interview highlights
- Business model iterations
- Market research findings
- Competitor analysis
- Links and references
- Uploaded files (e.g. pitch decks, wireframes)
- AI chats and summaries

Be verbose. That's the point. Capture the signal before it fades.

You can use tags on quests to group work by theme, topic, or status (e.g. #validation, #fundraising, #team, #product).

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick way to start using reconfigured for your startup journey right now:

1. **Create your first quest**: "Explore Business Model Options"
2. **Add a simple objective**: "Research 3 potential revenue streams"
3. **Make your first entry**: Write down what you're currently working on or thinking about
4. **Create a second quest** for a specific validation experiment you're running
5. **Link useful resources** you've found as entries

Remember that the goal is to build a useful trail of your thinking that you can return to later.

## Quick Setup

One of the most critical startup activities is customer discovery — let's use that as an example.

Here's a starter layout you can copy-paste into a new startup quest:

```markdown
# Quest: Customer Discovery for [Product Idea]

**Tags:** #validation #interviews

## Summary
Conduct customer discovery interviews to validate problem hypothesis and refine value proposition. Target 20+ interviews with potential users to understand pain points, current solutions, and willingness to pay.

## Objectives
- [ ] Define interview hypotheses
- [ ] Create discussion guide
- [ ] Identify and recruit participants
- [ ] Conduct interviews
- [ ] Analyze patterns and insights
- [ ] Refine product concept
- [ ] Create validation experiment
```

## Example Entries for Your Founder Journal

Below are examples of entries you might create while working on your startup journey:

### Entry Types for Customer Discovery Example

#### Daily Log
> Completed 3 more customer interviews today. Consistent theme emerging around manual data entry being a major pain point.
> Potential pivot insight: Users care more about integration than we thought. Exploring API-first approach.

#### Interview Notes
> Interview with Sarah (Marketing Director at Mid-Size SaaS)
> - Currently using 3 different tools with manual data transfers
> - Spends 4+ hours weekly on reporting
> - Budget decision made quarterly, $5-10K range available
> - Key quote: "I'd pay immediately for something that automates this nightmare"
> Follow up: Share concept mockup for feedback next week

#### Hypothesis Evolution
> Original hypothesis: SMBs need better analytics dashboards
> Refined after 15 interviews: SMBs need automated data consolidation from multiple platforms first, with simple reporting outputs
> Key learning: Solving the input problem is more valuable than better visualization

#### Link Reference
**Title:** How to Conduct Problem Interviews

**Note:** Great framework for non-leading questions. Using the "tell me about the last time you..." approach in next interviews.

## Structuring Objectives & Sidequests

Use **objectives** to break your main quest into manageable pieces.
Each objective becomes a linked quest where you can explore deeply without cluttering the main timeline.

### Example Structure

**Main Quest:** Launch MVP

**Objectives → Sidequests:**

- Define feature set → `MVP feature prioritization`
- Design user experience → `User flow wireframes`
- Build prototype → `Technical implementation plan`
- Set up analytics → `User behavior tracking framework`
- Plan launch → `Go-to-market strategy`

This makes your work navigable, modular, and easier to revisit or share.

## Additional Entry Types for Startup Founders

Here are more examples of entry types that are useful in the startup journey:

### Product Decision Documentation

**Decision:** Delaying social features to v2  
**Rationale:**
> - Core utility provides standalone value
> - Social features add technical complexity
> - Feedback shows users primarily need the core solution
> - Can market and launch faster without this scope
> Trade-off: May have lower engagement initially, but higher chance of shipping on time

### Experiment Results

> Landing Page A/B Test Results:
> - Variant A (problem-focused): 2.3% conversion to email signup
> - Variant B (solution-focused): 1.8% conversion to email signup
> - 500 visitors per variant, statistically significant
> Key insight: Early-stage prospects respond better to problem framing than solution details.

### Investor Meeting Notes

**Meeting with:** Jane Smith, Partner at Acme Ventures  
**Date:** June 15, 2024  
**Key Feedback:**
> - Business model makes sense but traction metrics need work
> - Suggested focusing on one vertical initially
> - Wants to see 15% MoM growth for 3+ months
> - Interested in reconnecting when we hit $10K MRR
> Next steps: Update outreach strategy to focus on legal vertical, build specialized features

### AI Assisted Summaries

**Prompt:** Summarize key patterns from our customer interviews so far  
**Response:** Based on your notes from 12 interviews, the consistent pain points are time spent on manual data entry...

### Market Research Notes

> Competitor pricing analysis:
> - Incumbent A: $49/user/month, full-service platform
> - Startup B: $19/user/month, limited features
> - Enterprise C: $10K+ monthly contracts
> Positioning opportunity: Price at $29/user/month with focused feature set that solves the core problem better than any existing solution

## Common Use Cases for Startup Founders

| When to use reconfigured | Why it helps |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Tracking customer conversations | Document insights, patterns, and exact quotes that shape your thinking |
| Documenting pivots and decisions | Record context and rationale for major changes in direction |
| Managing fundraising process | Keep investor conversations, feedback, and follow-ups organized |
| Planning product roadmap | Track feature ideas, prioritization decisions, and user feedback |
| Preparing for team discussions | Gather data points, options, and recommendations in linked entries |
| Preserving institutional knowledge | Maintain the "why" behind decisions as your company grows |

## Tips from Experienced Founders

- **Use screenshots liberally**: Capture mockups, analytics dashboards, and competitor websites
- **Create weekly reflection entries**: Regularly assess what you've learned and how it changes your thinking
- **Link to external tools**: Reference customer conversations, analytics data, and planning documents
- **Use structured tags**: Build a consistent tagging system (e.g., #customer, #product, #investor)
- **Create a "Founder resources" quest**: Collect useful tools, articles, and advice you discover
- **Document assumptions**: Explicitly state what you believe to be true and test systematically

## Final Thoughts

Don't overthink structure early on. Start with a single quest. Use objectives to break it down. Let sidequests emerge naturally as your thinking evolves.

The most important habit is consistent capture. Be verbose. Be messy. That's how hunches become hypotheses and hypotheses become validated business models.
