# Journaling UX Research Work in reconfigured

Welcome to your guide for using reconfigured to track and organize UX research work. Whether you're planning studies, conducting interviews, analyzing findings, or sharing insights, reconfigured helps you create a journal of your thinking — structured around quests.

This document walks through:

- The core concepts of quests, objectives, and entries
- A quick setup to get started
- Real-world examples of how to structure your UX research work using reconfigured

## Core Concepts

### Quests

A quest is a loose but defined container for a topic. It's up to you to decide what a quest is, but typically a quest is a question or a desired answer for a question. It could be:

- A complete research study
- A specific usability investigation
- A series of user interviews
- A question about user behavior you're trying to answer

Rule of thumb: If you'd want to revisit, share, or reflect on it later — make it a quest.

### Objectives → Sidequests

Each quest can have objectives, which are automatically treated as linked subquests. This allows you to break the work down into smaller chunks without cluttering the main thread.

We recommend a structure like:

```
Main Quest: Understand Mobile Checkout Experience
├── Objective: Plan research approach
│     → Sidequest: Research methodology selection
├── Objective: Conduct usability sessions
│     → Sidequest: Mobile checkout usability tests
├── Objective: Analyze findings
│     → Sidequest: Pattern analysis and recommendations
```

This keeps your project clean, focused, and expandable as you learn more.

### Entries

Entries are your trail of thought. They can be:

- Long-form notes
- Interview transcripts
- Research plans
- Observation notes
- Analysis frameworks
- Links and references
- Uploaded files (e.g. recordings, affinity diagrams)
- AI chats and summaries

Be verbose. That's the point. Capture the signal before it fades.

You can use tags on quests to group work by theme, topic, or status (e.g. #usability, #interviews, #survey, #synthesis).

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick way to start using reconfigured for your UX research work right now:

1. **Create your first quest**: "Explore User Pain Points"
2. **Add a simple objective**: "Identify 3 critical user journeys to investigate"
3. **Make your first entry**: Write down what you're currently working on or thinking about
4. **Create a second quest** for a specific research study you're planning
5. **Link useful resources** you've found as entries

Remember that the goal is to build a useful trail of your thinking that you can return to later.

## Quick Setup

One of the most common UX research activities is conducting a usability study — let's use that as an example.

Here's a starter layout you can copy-paste into a new UX research quest:

```markdown
# Quest: Mobile App Usability Study

**Tags:** #usability #mobile

> Also noting that 5/8 participants so far have tried to use the search function for finding specific settings.

#### Participant Notes
> Participant #4 (Sophia, 28, marketing professional)
> - Completed onboarding in 3:45 (faster than average)
> - Struggled to find notification preferences (spent 1:20 searching)
> - Discovered content recommendation feature organically
> - Quote: "I like how it shows related content, but I'm not sure why it's recommending these specific items"
> - Overall task success: 4/5 completed
> Observation: High digital literacy but still encountered navigation issues in settings area

#### Research Plan
> **Mobile Usability Study Plan**

## Structuring Objectives & Sidequests

Use **objectives** to break your main quest into manageable pieces.
Each objective becomes a linked quest where you can explore deeply without cluttering the main timeline.

### Example Structure

**Main Quest:** Understand user onboarding experience

**Objectives → Sidequests:**

- Plan methodology → `Onboarding research approach`
- Recruit participants → `Participant screening and scheduling`
- Conduct research → `Onboarding user interviews`
- Analyze findings → `Onboarding friction points analysis`
- Generate insights → `Onboarding improvement recommendations`

This makes your work navigable, modular, and easier to revisit or share.

## Additional Entry Types for UX Researchers

Here are more examples of entry types that are useful in UX research work:

### Visual Documentation

**Uploaded:** affinity_diagram_usability_findings.jpg  
**Note:** Clustered findings from 12 participants showing 4 major pain point categories, with "account settings" having the most issues.

### Insight Documentation

> **Key Finding: Search Behavior**
> Observation: 9/12 participants used search as primary navigation method when completing specific tasks
> Pattern: Users expected to find features by searching for their exact name rather than browsing menu categories
> Impact: Features without searchable terms or with technical naming conventions were consistently harder to find
> Recommendation: Implement comprehensive search with synonym support and ensure feature naming aligns with user vocabulary

### Stakeholder Meeting Notes

**Meeting:** Research Readout with Product Team  
**Date:** June 15, 2024  
**Key Questions:**
> - Is the navigation issue affecting all user segments equally?
> - How does this compare to desktop behavior?
> - What quick wins can we implement while planning larger navigation changes?
> Action Items: Share detailed navigation recommendations, conduct follow-up analysis of behavior by segment, prioritize quick fixes for search functionality

### AI Assisted Summaries

**Prompt:** Summarize key themes from our user interview transcripts  
**Response:** Across your 8 user interviews, three consistent themes emerge: confusion about pricing tiers...

### Methodology Notes

> **Remote vs. In-person Testing Comparison**
> After conducting both remote (8 participants) and in-person (4 participants) sessions:
> - Remote sessions allowed for more diverse geographic participation
> - In-person sessions captured more subtle emotional reactions and body language
> - Remote sessions had more technical issues but were more cost-effective
> - Data quality was comparable for task success metrics
> Decision: Continue with primarily remote testing but include 2-3 in-person sessions for each major study to capture richer contextual information

## Common Use Cases for UX Researchers

| When to use reconfigured | Why it helps |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Planning research studies | Document goals, methods, and protocols in one organized place |
| Capturing interview notes | Maintain detailed records of sessions and observations |
| Analyzing research data | Track patterns, quotes, and insights as they emerge |
| Managing research operations | Track participant recruiting, scheduling, and incentives |
| Synthesizing findings | Develop frameworks and themes from raw data |
| Preparing for presentations | Gather insights, evidence, and recommendations in linked entries |

## Tips from Experienced UX Researchers

- **Use screenshots liberally**: Capture user flows, interface states, and behavior patterns
- **Create research logs**: Document each session with consistent structure for easier synthesis
- **Link to research artifacts**: Connect to recordings, transcripts, and raw data
- **Use structured tags**: Build a consistent tagging system (e.g., #interview, #usability, #insight)
- **Create a "Research methods" quest**: Collect techniques, templates, and best practices
- **Document direct user quotes**: Preserve exact language to maintain authentic user voice

## Final Thoughts

Don't overthink structure early on. Start with a single quest. Use objectives to break it down. Let sidequests emerge naturally as your thinking evolves.

The most important habit is consistent capture. Be verbose. Be messy. That's how observations become insights.
