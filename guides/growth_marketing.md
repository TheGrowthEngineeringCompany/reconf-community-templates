# Journaling Growth Marketing Projects in reconfigured

Welcome to your guide for using reconfigured to track and organize growth marketing work. Whether you're running campaigns, optimizing conversion funnels, or testing new channels, reconfigured helps you create a journal of your thinking — structured around quests.

This document walks through:

- The core concepts of quests, objectives, and entries
- A quick setup to get started
- Real-world examples of how to structure your growth marketing work using reconfigured

## Core Concepts

### Quests

A quest is a loose but defined container for a topic. It's up to you to decide what a quest is, but typically a quest is a question or a desired answer for a question. It could be:

- A full growth marketing campaign
- A channel strategy exploration
- A landing page optimization experiment
- A question about conversion behavior you're trying to answer

Rule of thumb: If you'd want to revisit, share, or reflect on it later — make it a quest.

### Objectives → Sidequests

Each quest can have objectives, which are automatically treated as linked subquests. This allows you to break the work down into smaller chunks without cluttering the main thread.

We recommend a structure like:

```
Main Quest: Improve Landing Page Conversion Rate
├── Objective: Analyze current performance
│     → Sidequest: Landing page heatmap analysis
├── Objective: Develop test variations
│     → Sidequest: A/B test copy variations
├── Objective: Optimize CTA placement
│     → Sidequest: Button placement test results
```

This keeps your project clean, focused, and expandable as you learn more.

### Entries

Entries are your trail of thought. They can be:

- Long-form notes
- Hypotheses
- Campaign performance data
- Ad copy variations
- Channel metrics comparisons
- Links and references
- Uploaded files (e.g. heatmaps, conversion funnels)
- AI chats and summaries

Be verbose. That's the point. Capture the signal before it fades.

You can use tags on quests to group work by theme, topic, or status (e.g. #acquisition, #conversion, #retention, #email).

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick way to start using reconfigured for your growth marketing work right now:

1. **Create your first quest**: "Explore Growth Channel Ideas"
2. **Add a simple objective**: "Research 3 potential acquisition channels"
3. **Make your first entry**: Write down what you're currently working on or thinking about
4. **Create a second quest** for a specific campaign or experiment you're running
5. **Link useful resources** you've found as entries

Remember that the goal is to build a useful trail of your thinking that you can return to later.

## Quick Setup

One of the most common growth marketing projects is optimizing ad campaign performance — let's use that as an example.

Here's a starter layout you can copy-paste into a new growth marketing quest:

```markdown
# Quest: Optimize Facebook Ad Campaign Performance

**Tags:** #acquisition #facebook

## Example Entries for Your Growth Marketing Journal

Below are examples of entries you might create while working on your growth marketing projects:

### Entry Types for Ad Campaign Optimization Example

#### Daily Log
> Reviewed last week's campaign performance — seeing 2.4x ROAS on lookalike audiences but only 1.1x on interest-based.
> Created 5 new ad variations with social proof messaging. Will test against feature-focused ads starting tomorrow.

#### Hypothesis
> I suspect our conversion rate drops on weekends because our target audience (B2B) is less likely to make work-related decisions.
> Will test reducing bid amounts on weekends and reallocating budget to weekdays.

#### Metrics Snapshot
> Ad Set A (Benefits-focused):
> CTR: 2.3%, CVR: 4.8%, CPC: $1.42, ROAS: 1.8x
> Ad Set B (Social proof):
> CTR: 3.1%, CVR: 5.7%, CPC: $1.37, ROAS: 2.2x

## Structuring Objectives & Sidequests

Use **objectives** to break your main quest into manageable pieces.
Each objective becomes a linked quest where you can explore deeply without polluting the main timeline.

### Example Structure

**Main Quest:** Launch referral program

**Objectives → Sidequests:**

- Research successful programs → `Competitor referral program analysis`
- Define incentive structure → `Incentive options and financial modeling`
- Design user experience → `Referral flow design and mockups`
- Set up tracking → `Attribution and conversion tracking setup`
- Plan launch campaign → `Referral program announcement strategy`

This makes your work navigable, modular, and easier to revisit or share.

Don't overthink structure early on. Start with a single quest. Use objectives to break it down. Let sidequests emerge naturally as your thinking evolves.

The most important habit is consistent capture. Be verbose. Be messy. That's how experiments become evidence.
