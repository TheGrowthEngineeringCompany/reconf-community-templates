# Journaling Software Engineering Work in reconfigured

Welcome to your guide for using reconfigured to track and organize software engineering work. Whether you're building features, fixing bugs, refactoring code, or exploring new technologies, reconfigured helps you create a journal of your thinking — structured around quests.

This document walks through:

- The core concepts of quests, objectives, and entries
- A quick setup to get started
- Real-world examples of how to structure your engineering work using reconfigured

## Core Concepts

### Quests

A quest is a loose but defined container for a topic. It's up to you to decide what a quest is, but typically a quest is a question or a desired answer for a question. It could be:

- A feature implementation
- A complex bug investigation
- A tech debt reduction effort
- A question about architecture you're trying to answer

Rule of thumb: If you'd want to revisit, share, or reflect on it later — make it a quest.

### Objectives → Sidequests

Each quest can have objectives, which are automatically treated as linked subquests. This allows you to break the work down into smaller chunks without cluttering the main thread.

We recommend a structure like:

```
Main Quest: Implement Authentication System
├── Objective: Research auth options
│     → Sidequest: Auth library comparison
├── Objective: Design auth flow
│     → Sidequest: Auth architecture diagram
├── Objective: Implement login flow
│     → Sidequest: Login component development
```

This keeps your project clean, focused, and expandable as you learn more.

### Entries

Entries are your trail of thought. They can be:

- Long-form notes
- Code snippets
- Debugging sessions
- Architecture diagrams
- Performance analysis
- Links and references
- Uploaded files (e.g. logs, screenshots)
- AI chats and summaries

Be verbose. That's the point. Capture the signal before it fades.

You can use tags on quests to group work by theme, topic, or status (e.g. #feature, #bug, #refactor, #performance).

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick way to start using reconfigured for your engineering work right now:

1. **Create your first quest**: "Explore State Management Options"
2. **Add a simple objective**: "Research 3 potential state libraries"
3. **Make your first entry**: Write down what you're currently working on or thinking about
4. **Create a second quest** for a specific feature or bug you're working on
5. **Link useful resources** you've found as entries

Remember that the goal is to build a useful trail of your thinking that you can return to later.

## Quick Setup

One of the most common engineering activities is implementing a new feature — let's use that as an example.

Here's a starter layout you can copy-paste into a new engineering quest:

```markdown
# Quest: Implement User Notification System

**Tags:** #feature #notifications

## Summary
Build a flexible notification system that supports multiple channels (in-app, email, push) with customizable templates and delivery rules. Must support batching and user preferences.

## Objectives
- [ ] Research notification architecture patterns
- [ ] Design data model and API
- [ ] Create notification service
- [ ] Implement in-app notifications UI
- [ ] Add email integration
- [ ] Develop user preference controls
- [ ] Write tests and documentation
```

## Example Entries for Your Engineering Journal

Below are examples of entries you might create while working on your engineering projects:

### Entry Types for Feature Implementation Example

#### Daily Log
> Spent the morning investigating notification batching options. Redis sorted sets look promising for this use case.
> Created proof of concept for delivery scheduling with throttling support. Basic tests passing.

#### Technical Decision
> **Decision**: Using a queue-based approach rather than real-time delivery
> **Rationale**:
> - More resilient to downstream service outages
> - Better support for retry logic
> - Easier to implement rate limiting and batching
> - Scales better with high notification volume
> - Trade-off: Slightly increased complexity and potential for delayed delivery

#### Code Snippet
> New helper function for formatting notification payloads:
> ```javascript
> function formatNotification(template, data, options = {}) {
>   const { channel = 'in-app', locale = 'en-US' } = options;
>   
>   // Load template based on channel and locale
>   const templateString = getTemplate(template, channel, locale);
>   
>   // Apply data to template
>   const content = interpolate(templateString, data);
>   
>   return {
>     content,
>     channel,
>     metadata: {
>       template,
>       locale,
>       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
>     }
>   };
> }
> ```
> Note: Will need to add validation and error handling.

**Note:** Good overview of queue-based approach benefits, especially the section on handling backpressure.

## Structuring Objectives & Sidequests

Use **objectives** to break your main quest into manageable pieces.
Each objective becomes a linked quest where you can explore deeply without cluttering the main timeline.

### Example Structure

**Main Quest:** Implement search functionality

**Objectives → Sidequests:**

- Research options → `Search technology comparison`
- Design data model → `Search index schema`
- Build backend → `Search API implementation`
- Create frontend → `Search UI components`
- Optimize performance → `Search query optimization`

This makes your work navigable, modular, and easier to revisit or share.

## Additional Entry Types for Software Engineers

Here are more examples of entry types that are useful in engineering work:

### Architecture Documentation

**Uploaded:** notification_system_architecture.png  
**Note:** Shows flow from notification creation through queueing, delivery, and tracking with service boundaries.

### Bug Investigation Notes

> Debugging session for API timeout issue:
> - Error occurs after ~60 seconds on large dataset requests
> - Server logs show no errors, just client-side timeouts
> - Load testing reveals memory usage grows linearly with request size
> - Found: No pagination on large collection endpoint
> Root cause: Server processing entire collection before sending response
> Solution: Implement cursor-based pagination with reasonable default page size

### Performance Optimization Results

> Query optimization results:
> - Original: 1250ms average, 2.3s p95
> - Added index on (user_id, created_at): 380ms average, 620ms p95
> - Added query hint: 320ms average, 520ms p95
> - Denormalized status field: 120ms average, 210ms p95
> Overall: 10.4x performance improvement and much more consistent timing

### AI Assisted Summaries

**Prompt:** Summarize our approach to handling authentication and authorization  
**Response:** Your system uses JWT for authentication with short-lived access tokens and longer refresh tokens. Authorization uses RBAC with...

### Code Review Notes

> PR Review Feedback on Notification Service:
> - Good separation of concerns between creation and delivery
> - Missing error handling for third-party API failures
> - Need retries with exponential backoff for delivery attempts
> - Edge case: What happens when a user changes preferences mid-delivery?
> - Tests should mock Redis client rather than using test instance

## Common Use Cases for Software Engineers

| When to use reconfigured | Why it helps |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Building complex features | Track design decisions, implementation notes, and edge cases in one place |
| Debugging difficult issues | Document reproduction steps, hypotheses, and solutions methodically |
| Refactoring legacy code | Map the current state, approach, and progress as you modernize |
| Researching technical options | Compare alternatives with specific criteria and proof of concepts |
| Conducting code reviews | Capture feedback, patterns, and improvement ideas in a structured way |
| Documenting architecture | Maintain context, diagrams, and trade-offs for significant technical decisions |

## Tips from Experienced Engineers

- **Use screenshots liberally**: Capture error messages, diagrams, and UI states
- **Create debugging journals**: Track hypotheses, tests, and results when solving complex issues
- **Link to repositories**: Reference specific commits or PRs when implementing key functionality
- **Use structured tags**: Build a consistent tagging system (e.g., #bug, #refactor, #performance)
- **Create a "Code snippets" quest**: Collect useful patterns and solutions for reuse
- **Document decision context**: Record not just what was decided, but why and what alternatives were considered

## Final Thoughts

Don't overthink structure early on. Start with a single quest. Use objectives to break it down. Let sidequests emerge naturally as your thinking evolves.

The most important habit is consistent capture. Be verbose. Be messy. That's how code becomes maintainable.
