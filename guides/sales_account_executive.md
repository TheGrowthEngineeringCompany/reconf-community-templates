# Journaling Sales Activities in reconfigured

Welcome to your guide for using reconfigured to track and organize your sales work. Whether you're researching prospects, building relationships, managing deal cycles, or strategizing account plans, reconfigured helps you create a journal of your thinking — structured around quests.

This document walks through:

- The core concepts of quests, objectives, and entries
- A quick setup to get started
- Real-world examples of how to structure your sales work using reconfigured

## Core Concepts

### Quests

A quest is a loose but defined container for a topic. It's up to you to decide what a quest is, but typically a quest is a question or a desired answer for a question. It could be:

- A specific sales opportunity
- An account strategy for a key prospect
- A vertical or industry focus
- A question about a prospect's buying process

Rule of thumb: If you'd want to revisit, share, or reflect on it later — make it a quest.

### Objectives → Sidequests

Each quest can have objectives, which are automatically treated as linked subquests. This allows you to break the work down into smaller chunks without cluttering the main thread.

We recommend a structure like:

```
Main Quest: Win Acme Corp Enterprise Deal
├── Objective: Map decision makers
│     → Sidequest: Acme Corp org chart research
├── Objective: Understand technical requirements
│     → Sidequest: Product fit analysis for Acme
├── Objective: Build executive champion relationship
│     → Sidequest: CTO engagement strategy
```

This keeps your deal progression clean, focused, and expandable as you learn more.

### Entries

Entries are your trail of thought. They can be:

- Meeting notes
- Research findings
- Competitive intelligence
- Call and email summaries
- Account strategy reflections
- Objection handling approaches
- Links to relevant resources
- Uploaded files (e.g. account plans, proposals)
- AI chats and summaries

Be verbose. That's the point. Capture the signal before it fades.

You can use tags on quests to group work by theme, topic, or status (e.g. #enterprise, #healthcare, #discovery, #negotiation).

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick way to start using reconfigured for your sales work right now:

1. **Create your first quest**: "Build Q3 Pipeline Strategy"
2. **Add a simple objective**: "Research 3 target accounts in healthcare"
3. **Make your first entry**: Write down what you're currently working on or thinking about
4. **Create a second quest** for a specific sales opportunity you're working on
5. **Link useful resources** you've found as entries

Remember that the goal is to build a useful trail of your thinking that you can return to later.

## Quick Setup

One of the most common sales activities is managing an enterprise opportunity — let's use that as an example.

Here's a starter layout you can copy-paste into a new sales quest:

```markdown
# Quest: Win Global Financial Inc. Enterprise Deal

**Tags:** #enterprise #financial-services #q3-target

## Summary
Secure a 6-figure enterprise agreement with Global Financial Inc. for their North American operations. Target close date is end of Q3, with potential for global expansion in Q4.

## Objectives
- [ ] Research company structure and priorities
- [ ] Map key stakeholders and decision makers
- [ ] Identify and engage potential champions
- [ ] Understand competitive alternatives
- [ ] Align solution to specific business needs
- [ ] Navigate procurement process
- [ ] Negotiate and close contract
```

## Example Entries for Your Sales Journal

Below are examples of entries you might create while working on your sales activities:

### Entry Types for Enterprise Deal Example

#### Meeting Notes
> Discovery call with Sarah (VP Operations) - 6/12/24
> - Current process takes 3 full-time staff
> - Looking to reduce processing time by 40%+
> - Budget approval needed from finance committee
> - Timeline: needs solution in place by Q4
> Next steps: Send case study from similar financial company, schedule technical demo

#### Research Findings

> Their weakness: No industry-specific compliance features
> Our advantage: Financial services experience, SOC2 compliance, pre-built integrations with their core systems

#### Strategy Notes

> Plan to bring in our Director of Financial Services for next executive meeting.
> Will prepare ROI calculator customized to their transaction volume.

## Structuring Objectives & Sidequests

Use **objectives** to break your main quest into manageable pieces.
Each objective becomes a linked quest where you can explore deeply without polluting the main timeline.

### Example Structure

**Main Quest:** Enterprise Healthcare Deal

**Objectives → Sidequests:**

- Research organization → `Healthcare Inc. Company Analysis`
- Map stakeholders → `Healthcare Inc. Decision Makers`
- Understand workflow needs → `Current Process Pain Points`
- Build business case → `ROI Analysis for Healthcare Inc.`
- Navigate procurement → `Healthcare Inc. Buying Process`

This makes your work navigable, modular, and easier to revisit or share.

## Common Use Cases for Account Executives

| When to use reconfigured | Why it helps |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Managing complex sales cycles | Track all interactions, information, and next steps in one organized place |
| Preparing for important calls | Quickly access historical context and prepare targeted questions |
| Developing account strategies | Document relationship mapping and long-term engagement plans |
| Navigating competitive situations | Track competitive intelligence and develop countering strategies |
| Collaborating with solution teams | Keep technical requirements and solution designs accessible |
| Preparing for sales reviews | Gather deal progression evidence and next steps in linked entries |

## Tips from Experienced Sales Professionals

- **Document every interaction**: Brief notes after each call or email exchange maintain complete context
- **Create meeting preparation entries**: List objectives, questions, and relevant context before important meetings
- **Catalog objections and responses**: Build a personal library of effective responses to common concerns
- **Use structured tags**: Build a consistent tagging system (e.g., #discovery, #technical, #negotiation)
- **Create a "Sales resources" quest**: Collect useful case studies, presentations, and reference materials
- **Track deal momentum**: Note changes in urgency, engagement level, and buying signals

## Final Thoughts

Don't overthink structure early on. Start with a single quest. Use objectives to break it down. Let sidequests emerge naturally as your thinking evolves.

The most important habit is consistent capture. Be verbose. Be messy. That's how conversations become conversions.
