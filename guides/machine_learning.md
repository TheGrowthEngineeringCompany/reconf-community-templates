# Journaling Machine Learning Projects in reconfigured

Welcome to your guide for using reconfigured to track and organize machine learning work. Whether you're training models, reading papers, or tuning hyperparameters, reconfigured helps you create a journal of your thinking — structured around quests.

This document walks through:

- The core concepts of quests, objectives, and entries
- A quick setup to get started
- Real-world examples of how to structure your ML work using reconfigured

## Core Concepts

### Quests

A quest is a loose but defined container for a topic. It's up to you to decide what a quest is, but typically a quest is a question or a desired answer for a question. It could be:

- A full ML project
- A deep dive into a paper
- A specific model experiment
- A question you're trying to answer

Rule of thumb: If you'd want to revisit, share, or reflect on it later — make it a quest.

### Objectives → Sidequests

Each quest can have objectives, which are automatically treated as linked subquests. This allows you to break the work down into smaller chunks without cluttering the main thread.

We recommend a structure like:

```
Main Quest: Predict Customer Churn
├── Objective: Explore the dataset
│     → Sidequest: EDA on churn_data_2024.csv
├── Objective: Try baseline model
│     → Sidequest: Logistic Regression experiment
├── Objective: Improve model performance
│     → Sidequest: XGBoost with tuned parameters
```

This keeps your project clean, focused, and expandable as you learn more.

### Entries

Entries are your trail of thought. They can be:

- Long-form notes
- Hypotheses
- Debugging sessions
- Code observations
- Links and references
- Uploaded files (e.g. screenshots, plots)
- AI chats and summaries

Be verbose. That's the point. Capture the signal before it fades.

You can use tags on quests to group work by theme, topic, or status (e.g. #ml, #experiment, #regression, #pytorch).

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick way to start using reconfigured for your ML work right now:

1. **Create your first quest**: "Explore ML Project Ideas"
2. **Add a simple objective**: "Research 3 potential project areas"
3. **Make your first entry**: Write down what you're currently working on or thinking about
4. **Create a second quest** for a specific project or paper you're exploring
5. **Link useful resources** you've found as entries

Remember that the goal is to build a useful trail of your thinking that you can return to later.

## Quick Setup

One of the most common ML projects is predicting customer churn — let's use that as an example.

Here's a starter layout you can copy-paste into a new ML quest:

```markdown
# Quest: Predict Customer Churn

**Tags:** #ml

## Summary
Build a model that predicts whether a customer will churn, using transactional and demographic data. Aim to beat a 75% baseline accuracy while keeping the model explainable.

## Objectives
- [ ] Define the scope
- [ ] Do background research
- [ ] Explore the dataset
- [ ] Test a baseline model
- [ ] Evaluate performance
- [ ] Try alternative approaches
- [ ] Summarize findings
```

## Example Entries for Your ML Journal

Below are examples of entries you might create while working on your ML projects:

### Entry Types for Churn Prediction Example

#### Daily Log
> Spent the morning cleaning the dataset — removed ~3% of rows with missing tenure.
> Tried one-hot encoding `contract_type` but ended up with too many sparse columns. Will try frequency encoding tomorrow.

#### Hypothesis
> I suspect customers with month-to-month contracts are much more likely to churn.
> Will create a binary feature for contract type and compare distributions.

#### Metrics Snapshot
> Logistic Regression baseline:
> Accuracy: 72%, Precision: 0.68, Recall: 0.55.
> Will try SMOTE next — imbalance seems to be affecting recall.

#### Link Reference
**Title:** Predicting churn with gradient boosting — Medium article  
**Link:** https://medium.com/some-article  
**Note:** Interesting take on combining tenure with usage frequency to boost model performance.

## Structuring Objectives & Sidequests

Use **objectives** to break your main quest into manageable pieces.
Each objective becomes a linked quest where you can explore deeply without polluting the main timeline.

### Example Structure

**Main Quest:** Train LSTM for time series prediction

**Objectives → Sidequests:**

- Explore the dataset → `EDA: sales_by_day_2023.csv`
- Learn LSTM formatting → `Notes on sequence-to-sequence modeling`
- Train baseline model → `LSTM: 1 hidden layer`
- Tune parameters → `LSTM tuning: batch size + dropout`
- Analyze performance → `RMSE vs MAE evaluation`

This makes your work navigable, modular, and easier to revisit or share.

## Additional Entry Types for ML Work

Here are more examples of entry types that are useful in ML projects:

### Visual Documentation

**Uploaded:** feature_importance_plot.png  
**Note:** Contract type dominates. Rerun without it.

### Error Analysis Notes

> Found that false positives are concentrated in month-to-month contracts with high tenure.
> Hypothesis: Long-term customers on flexible contracts behave differently than our model expects.

### Literature References

**Title:** Great churn modeling guide on Kaggle  
**URL:** kaggle.com/something  
**Note:** Useful EDA plots + feature ideas

### AI Assisted Summaries

**Prompt:** Summarize what I've tried in feature engineering  
**Response:** You've added 3 features...

### Model Comparison Notes

> XGBoost vs Random Forest:
> - XGBoost: Better precision (0.81 vs 0.77), slower training
> - Random Forest: Better explainability, more stable across samples
> Decision: Going with Random Forest for production due to explainability requirements.

## Common Use Cases for ML Practitioners

| When to use reconfigured | Why it helps |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Exploring a new research paper | Track your understanding, questions, and implementation ideas as you read |
| Debugging a persistent model issue | Maintain hypotheses, attempted solutions, and results in one place |
| Comparing multiple model approaches | Document performance metrics, tradeoffs, and insights from each attempt |
| Learning a new ML technique | Create a quest with resources, code samples, and notes as you learn |
| Working across multiple projects | Keep context separate but searchable across different ML efforts |
| Preparing for a research meeting | Gather thoughts, results, and discussion points in linked entries |

## Tips from Experienced ML Users

- **Use screenshots liberally**: Capture model outputs, error messages, and visualizations directly in entries
- **Create daily log entries**: A quick recap of what you worked on helps maintain context between sessions
- **Link to notebook checkpoints**: Reference specific versions of your code when you make progress
- **Use structured tags**: Build a consistent tagging system (e.g., #experiment, #paper-review, #debug)
- **Create a "ML resources" quest**: Collect useful links, tools, and papers in a centralized place
- **Record model hyperparameters**: Document what you've tried and the impact on performance

## Final Thoughts

Don't overthink structure early on. Start with a single quest. Use objectives to break it down. Let sidequests emerge naturally as your thinking evolves.

The most important habit is consistent capture. Be verbose. Be messy. That's how ideas become progress.
