# Journaling Data Engineering Projects in reconfigured

Welcome to your guide for using reconfigured to track and organize data engineering work. Whether you're building data pipelines, optimizing ETL processes, or designing data models, reconfigured helps you create a journal of your thinking — structured around quests.

This document walks through:

- The core concepts of quests, objectives, and entries
- A quick setup to get started
- Real-world examples of how to structure your data engineering work using reconfigured

## Core Concepts

### Quests

A quest is a loose but defined container for a topic. It's up to you to decide what a quest is, but typically a quest is a question or a desired answer for a question. It could be:

- A full data engineering project
- A data integration problem
- A performance optimization challenge
- A question about data architecture you're trying to answer

Rule of thumb: If you'd want to revisit, share, or reflect on it later — make it a quest.

### Objectives → Sidequests

Each quest can have objectives, which are automatically treated as linked subquests. This allows you to break the work down into smaller chunks without cluttering the main thread.

We recommend a structure like:

```
Main Quest: Design Customer Data Warehouse
├── Objective: Map data sources
│     → Sidequest: Source system inventory
├── Objective: Design schema
│     → Sidequest: Star schema for customer transactions
├── Objective: Build ETL pipelines
│     → Sidequest: Airflow DAG implementation
```

This keeps your project clean, focused, and expandable as you learn more.

### Entries

Entries are your trail of thought. They can be:

- Long-form notes
- Architecture diagrams
- SQL queries
- Pipeline configurations
- Performance test results
- Links and references
- Uploaded files (e.g. schema diagrams, error logs)
- AI chats and summaries

Be verbose. That's the point. Capture the signal before it fades.

You can use tags on quests to group work by theme, topic, or status (e.g. #etl, #performance, #schema, #troubleshooting).

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

Here's a quick way to start using reconfigured for your data engineering work right now:

1. **Create your first quest**: "Explore Data Platform Options"
2. **Add a simple objective**: "Research 3 potential warehouse solutions"
3. **Make your first entry**: Write down what you're currently working on or thinking about
4. **Create a second quest** for a specific pipeline or integration you're building
5. **Link useful resources** you've found as entries

Remember that the goal is to build a useful trail of your thinking that you can return to later.

## Quick Setup

One of the most common data engineering projects is building an ETL pipeline — let's use that as an example.

Here's a starter layout you can copy-paste into a new data engineering quest:

```markdown
# Quest: Build Marketing Data Pipeline

**Tags:** #etl #airflow

## Summary
Create a reliable ETL pipeline to extract data from multiple marketing platforms, transform it into a consistent format, and load it into our data warehouse for analysis. Support daily refreshes with error handling.

## Objectives
- [ ] Map source systems and schemas
- [ ] Design target data model
- [ ] Build extraction connectors
- [ ] Implement transformation logic
- [ ] Set up loading process
- [ ] Add monitoring and error handling
- [ ] Document the solution
```

## Example Entries for Your Data Engineering Journal

Below are examples of entries you might create while working on your data engineering projects:

### Entry Types for ETL Pipeline Example

#### Daily Log
> Spent the morning debugging Facebook API connector — rate limiting issues when pulling large date ranges.
> Implemented batching by week to stay under limits. Working smoothly now with 95% reduction in failures.

#### Problem Analysis
> Our Redshift cluster is showing high CPU utilization during the nightly ETL process.
> Looking at query plans, it seems the JSON parsing is causing the bottleneck. Will test pre-parsing in the transform layer.

#### Code Snippet
> New transformation function for handling inconsistent date formats:
> ```python
> def normalize_dates(date_str, format=None):
>     if format is None:
>         for fmt in DATE_FORMATS:
>             try:
>                 return datetime.strptime(date_str, fmt)
>             except ValueError:
>                 continue
>     return datetime.strptime(date_str, format)
> ```

## Structuring Objectives & Sidequests

Use **objectives** to break your main quest into manageable pieces.
Each objective becomes a linked quest where you can explore deeply without polluting the main timeline.

### Example Structure

**Main Quest:** Build data quality framework

**Objectives → Sidequests:**

- Research approaches → `Data quality methodologies review`
- Define metrics → `Key data quality KPIs`
- Implement tests → `dbt test implementation`
- Build monitoring → `Alerting system for quality issues`
- Create documentation → `Data quality runbook`

This makes your work navigable, modular, and easier to revisit or share.

## Additional Entry Types for Data Engineering Work

Here are more examples of entry types that are useful in data engineering projects:

### Architecture Diagram

**Uploaded:** data_warehouse_architecture.png  
**Note:** Shows flow from source systems through landing, staging, and serving layers with tools used at each stage.

### Performance Analysis Notes

> Query optimization results:
> - Original query: 380 seconds, 45GB scanned
> - With partitioning: 42 seconds, 5.2GB scanned
> - With materialized view: 3.8 seconds, 0.8GB scanned
> Key insight: Pre-aggregating daily stats had the biggest impact on performance.

### Technical Decision Documentation

**Title:** Choosing between Airflow and Prefect  
**Comparison:**
> Airflow:
> - Pros: Mature ecosystem, extensive connectors, familiar to team
> - Cons: Heavyweight for simple workflows, rigid scheduling
> Prefect:
> - Pros: Modern API, better failure handling, easier local development
> - Cons: Smaller community, fewer integrations
> Decision: Going with Airflow due to existing team knowledge and integration needs

### AI Assisted Summaries

**Prompt:** Summarize our approach to handling slowly changing dimensions  
**Response:** You're using Type 2 SCD for customer attributes, tracking history with effective dates and is_current flag...

### Troubleshooting Notes

> Pipeline failure investigation:
> - Error occurs during Redshift COPY from S3
> - Found malformed JSON in 3 files from yesterday's extract
> - Root cause: Source API changed date format from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD
> Solution: Added format detection logic to the transformation step, with tests for both formats

## Common Use Cases for Data Engineers

| When to use reconfigured | Why it helps |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Designing data architecture | Document requirements, options considered, and decisions in one place |
| Troubleshooting pipeline failures | Track hypotheses, tests, and solutions methodically |
| Managing database migrations | Plan, test, and document complex schema changes |
| Optimizing query performance | Document benchmarks, changes, and their impact |
| Evaluating new technologies | Compare options, test results, and implementation plans |
| Preparing for technical reviews | Gather context, diagrams, and decisions in linked entries |

## Tips from Experienced Data Engineers

- **Use screenshots liberally**: Capture error messages, query plans, and monitoring dashboards
- **Create daily log entries**: Track what you're working on to maintain context between sessions
- **Link to repositories**: Reference specific commits when implementing key functionality
- **Use structured tags**: Build a consistent tagging system (e.g., #etl, #warehouse, #optimization)
- **Create a "Data engineering resources" quest**: Collect useful snippets, configurations, and reference materials
- **Document data models**: Keep schema designs, entity relationships, and field definitions accessible

## Final Thoughts

Don't overthink structure early on. Start with a single quest. Use objectives to break it down. Let sidequests emerge naturally as your thinking evolves.

The most important habit is consistent capture. Be verbose. Be messy. That's how pipelines become production-ready.
